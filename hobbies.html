          I <em>absolutely</em> love watching movies and TV shows! I never
          understood why people loved to watch shows which had
          <strong>8 seasons with 13 episodes of 45 minutes each</strong>, untill
          I tried it out myself. The first ever show which I completely finished
          was <em>Game Of Thrones</em>. And I knew it had a controvertial
          reputation but <em>so many people</em> recommended the show and I just
          wanted to know why so many people across the globe were waiting for
          the last season.
          <br />
          My all time favorite show is <em>Shitt's Creek</em> though.

        I would've never though I would be saying this because I don't think I
        was fond of reading growing up. But I read somewhere that
        <quote
          >If you are bored of reading or don't like reading then you are simply
          reading the wrong book</quote
        >. And that is so true. I mostly read self-help books with occational
        fictional novels.

        I started woring out regularly when the lockdown started in 2020. I have
        stuck to it for a year. However the past few months have been not so
        great. I don't workout very often now and the motivation is somehow
        less. But I'm sure I'll get back to it soon.

        Okay so this one is not a hobby as such, it's just something I do on the
        weekends. I <em>hated</em> it before but now I have accepted the fact
        and try to make new, tasty recepies every weekend.
